A web-based Banking Management System to manage customer accounts, transactions, and administrative banking operations.



##  Project Overview

The Banking Management System is a software application designed to automate and manage core banking operations such as customer account management, transactions, and loan processing. The system aims to reduce manual effort, improve accuracy, and provide secure and efficient banking services. It serves as a centralized platform for administrators, bank staff, and customers to interact with banking data digitally. This project is developed as part of a **Software Engineering academic requirement**.



##  Problem It Solves

Traditional banking processes often rely on manual record keeping, which can lead to errors, data inconsistency, and delays.

Key problems addressed:
- Manual record maintenance
- Time-consuming transaction processing
- Higher chances of human error
- Difficulty for customers to access account information quickly

This system provides a digital solution that ensures faster processing, better data management, and improved user experience.
